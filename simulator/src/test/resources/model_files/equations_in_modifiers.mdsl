parameter z = 99 units
parameter y = 98 units
parameter x = 97 units

a contained simulation modifier z => c contained simulation modifier y

b contained simulation modifier x + y => c contained simulation

c contained simulation modifier (h contained simulation - a contained simulation) / (x * b contained simulation) + y <=> d contained simulation modifier (a contained simulation * x + b contained simulation * y) / (z - c contained simulation) 

e contained simulation modifier 2 * b contained simulation + 3.4 => b contained simulation

f contained simulation modifier a contained simulation + 3 * b contained simulation + 2 / z - 2.345 => b contained simulation

g contained simulation modifier (a contained simulation + 3) * (b contained simulation + 2) / (z - 2.345) => b contained simulation

h contained simulation modifier -3 * (b contained simulation - 12) => b contained simulation

i contained simulation modifier 3 * -(b contained simulation - 12) => b contained simulation

j contained simulation modifier a contained simulation * y => b contained simulation

k contained simulation modifier 53.7 => b contained simulation

l contained simulation modifier (12 + 3)*2 => b contained simulation
