# Example checking that reaction propensities are recalculated
#   after delayed reactions complete.
# Species x reaction is to make sure that the "previous reaction" changes
#   between the delay reaction starting and completing.

initial tree {simulation}

species a contained simulation = 1 units
species b contained simulation = 0 units
species c contained simulation = 0 units
species x contained simulation = 100 units

a contained simulation modifier 1 delay 10 => b contained simulation
b contained simulation modifier 1 => c contained simulation

x contained simulation modifier 10 => x contained simulation
