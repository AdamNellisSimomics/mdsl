#Testing how the engine handles rates of reactions.
#	 Behaviour: If you want an equation to have a half-time of h, then set its rate to: (ln(2) / h)
#	            This is the median of an exponential distribution with parameter h (p(x) = e^(-hx)).

initial tree { simulation }

species A contained simulation = 10 mol.liter^-1
species B contained simulation = 1000 mol.liter^-1

parameter rate = 0.05776226504 units # ln(2) / 12

A contained simulation modifier rate => decay

B contained simulation modifier rate => decay
