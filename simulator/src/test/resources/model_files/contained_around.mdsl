# Model file using "around membrane" and "contained simulation", which are synonyms

initial tree {simulation {4 membrane}}

# Should be initialised the same
species a contained simulation = 100 units
species b around membrane = 100 units

# Reactions should be the same
a contained simulation modifier 10 => decay
b around membrane modifier 10 => decay
